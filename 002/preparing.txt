hello, first_name, now we are going to print out your letter with some formatting.
Dear first_name, How are you? I am fine. I miss you so much, I think you deserve the world, yet somehow I don’t think you always see that. But I want you to know, I often find my own self wondering what I did to deserve you.
You taught me what a soulmate really is, and I wouldn’t be able to survive without having you in my life. You come in to people’s lives with a purpose and you change them. You make every single person around you better, without even realizing it.
by the way, Have you seen friend_name lately? if you see friend_name please ask $gender to call me as soon as possible.
lastly, I hear you just had a birthday and you are $age years old, and i think next year you will be $age+1/$vote/$retirement. Hope you fine.
yours sincerely,

Mohamed Yehia.
